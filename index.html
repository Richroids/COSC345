                I am enrolled in this program as part of a post-graduate diploma, meaning this is only my first year of concentrated studies in computer science. I have no experience at all in HTML,Javascript,CSS,SVG or the<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>element and some introductory experience in Java. Nonetheless, my BSc in energy studies has given me skills and ways of thinking that thus far have helped me to keep pace. What I do bring to the table are skills not readily nutured in computer science, such as essay writing and academic research, alongside a desire to learn and see results

                The strengths I bring to the team are in visual design(front-end). I have an understanding of photoshop which allows me to display ideas and designs effectively. I have next to no experience with javascript, html, css, and all of the other languages listed. I have a keen eye for presentation and an aim to produce efficient code with low memory demands, and clear annotation.

            I am in my third year of studying Software Engineering. I have a few years experience in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, but not the others. I have a few years coding experience, mainly in Java and Python, and am well acquainted with the processes involved in producing software from start to finish. I enjoy solving problems and learning new techniques to solve problems with.

        <p>
            For our editor we are after a heavyweight, modern IDE that can support TypeScript. A heavyweight IDE provides error checking and find usage functionality that can act as early debugging detection alongside time-saving features such as code completion. These requirements narrow down the options to some of the more well known IDE's that have had plugins written for TypeScript, and then some more specific editors that are designed to support TypeScript.

(source) while visual studio does get them rapidly, other IDE's appear a bit faster. Also visual studio runs only on Windows which could make it diificult for group members with mac based hardware. </td>
