            <p>
            I am enrolled in this program as part of a post-graduate diploma, meaning this is only my first year of 
            concentrated studies in computer science. I have no experience at all in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SVG or 
            the<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>element and some introductory experience in Java. Nonetheless, my BSc in 
            energy studies has given me skills and ways of thinking that thus far have helped me to keep pace. What I 
            do bring to the table are skills not readily nurtured in computer science, such as essay writing and academic 
            research, alongside a desire to learn and see results

            <p>
            The strengths I bring to the team are in visual design(front-end). I have an understanding of PhotoShop which allows me to display ideas and designs effectively. I have next to no experience with javascript, html, css, and all of the other languages listed. I have a keen eye for presentation and an aim to produce efficient code with low memory demands, and clear annotation.

            <p>
            I am in my third year of studying Software Engineering. I have a few years experience in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, but not the others. I have a few years coding experience, mainly in Java and Python, and am well acquainted with the processes involved in producing software from start to finish. I enjoy solving problems and learning new techniques to solve problems with.

        <h2>The App</h2>
        <h2>Version Control</h2>
        <h2>Programming Language</h2>
        <h2>Editor</h2>
        
       	<p>
       	For our editor we are after a heavy-weight, modern IDE that can support TypeScript. A heavy-weight IDE provides error checking and find usage functionality that can act as early debugging detection alongside time-saving features such as code completion. These requirements narrow down the options to some of the more well known IDE's that have had plug-ins written for TypeScript, and then some more specific editors that are designed to support TypeScript.
        </p>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Editor</th>
                    <th>Pros</th>
                    <th>Cons</th>
                </tr>
                    <td><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio</a></td>
                    <td>TypeScript is a Microsoft associated language and so it would appear logical that a Microsoft IDE would provide the most up to date support for TypseScript.</td>
                    <td>Some Internet users have tested to see what IDE gets the most immediate updates when a new version of TypeScript is released. (source) while visual studio does get them rapidly, other IDE's appear a bit faster. Also visual studio runs only on Windows which could make it difficult for group members with mac based hardware. </td>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></td>
                    <td>Atom is a text editor which prides itself on user customisation while maintaining features and usability. It has implemented support for TypseScript updates (using an extension download) faster than all the other editors also and has cross platform support.</td>
                    <td>None of our group members have heard of atom before this project and some believe that our time spent up-skilling could be spent more valuably</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a></td>
                    <td>This is a modern, powerful IDE that all group members are quite familiar with. It has full 
                    TypseScript support with fast updates for new versions are a functional plug-in. It runs on windows and mac and additionally comes pre-installed on all computers in the labs at Owheo. Eclipse can also directly push and pull to a github repository; simplifying another task that will be new to most of us.</td>
                    <td>Some of the group members are more familiar with NetBeans than Eclipse. Also as it relies on a third party plug continued support is not assured.</td>00000
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a></td>
                    <td>Again, this is a modern IDE that all the group are familiar with and some of the group are more familiar with this than NetBeans. It comes with all the benefits that Eclipse has.</td>
                    <td>NetBeans can be slower to get updates for TypeScript and the plug in does not seem to be as reliable. It requires command line complimation and all in all is not updated as regularly or as comprehensively as the Eclipse plug-in.</td>
        
                </tr> 
           </table>          
       
        <p>
        Overall, familiarity and functionality are the main requirements of our coders; so long as the editor has full support for
         our chosen language and is a heavy-weight IDE. This has lead to our group choosing Eclipse as our editor of 
         choice. This remains a flexible decision and if any issues arise with 
         TypeScript version support or anything not foreseen then we shall choose the next best editor based on our 
         issues with Eclipse.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the app we will be using <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html">Android Studio</a> 
        as it contains many features that are specifically engineered  towards the development of an Android smart watch 
        application. 
        </p>
        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <h2>Task Management</h2>
        <p>
        Much of the time spent before the second assignment will be spent up-skilling. As it is hard to know about things
        you do not yet know this will be hard to estimate. For this reason we plan to leave an arbitrary amount of time
        between each release which each group member can spend learning things as they discover it needs to be learned.
        As there are experience differences in the group, work should be able to continue as the more inexperienced members
        get themselves up to speed. At the moment the planned time allowed for this is two weeks/10 days.
        </p>
        <p>
        For task management it seems best to follow a scrum style organisation structure. 
        This will give us clear goals with a measurable time-frame to help understand how our work processes are 
        advancing us to our end release goals. The initial phase of this is to create a list of user stories that 
        define the release features from an end user perspective. This necessarily breaks down a big project into more 
        manageable pieces, that can evaluated and given more accurate time estimations compared to estimating as a whole.   
        </p>
        <p>The estimations made attempt to take into consideration that we are all university students with other papers 
        and lives; unlike most software engineers this is not our full time job. To try and avoid the planning fallacy 
        I have considered the size of weekly lab projects for other computer science papers and used this as a benchmark 
        for the size of a 5 day project. Checking our tasks against these lab time-frames designed for students of our level 
        and paper load should yield a more accurate assessment. The workload has been divided into function points
        according to user stories.
        </p>
            
        <h3>User Stories</h3>
        <p>
        The basic functionality we are looking to implement will be based around satisfying these user stories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>As a user I want an analog clock to tell the time. -6 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want upcoming tasks and events to overlay the analog clock to accessibly show events in the next
            12 hours. -6 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want to be able to sync my smart watch with a more heavy-weight app. -6 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want the calendar to update as events pass to make sure only relevant information is displayed
             - 4 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want to be able to view additional information about an event at a touch. - 6 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want to be reminded of an event before it happens. - 4 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want additional information about an event to be displayed at time of a reminder. -1 day</li>
            <li>As a user I want a stylish display. - 8 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want to be able to colour differentiate between different types of events. - 4 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        And as optional functionality if time permits:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>As a user I want to be able to delete a calendar entry -6 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want to be able to have different reminder vibrations for different event types to quickly
             distinguish the upcoming event -16 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want to be able to view the weeks events -8 days</li>
            <li>As a user I want to be able to view the months events -8 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Excluding the extra functionality, this gives a total of 45 days, or 9 working weeks.
        This is bumped up to 55 days/11 working weeks when taking into account the time required to learn the tools
        needed for the project. The finished product assessment is in 65 working days excluding holidays and exam period
        any extra time the test team needs before release.
        </p>
        <p>   
        In the meantime, our draft code is expected 27 working days after this report. 
        Our release goal for this is to have a designed (8 days), analog clock (6 days) with an overlaid calendar (6 days)
         linked to a heavy-weight app or repository (6 days) which should take a total of 26 working days to build,
         with testing running simultaneously. This does not leave any time allocated for report writing meaning that
         this will be done concurrently also.
        </p>
        <h3>Finances</h3>
        <p>Accounting for the total project, which is expected to last 55 days, at 8 hours a day, we expect to charge
        an hourly rate of $30, totaling $13200. Because the workload of the project is split four ways, it will not take
        four of us working full-time 55 days to complete this project, so I believe that this costing is accurate and should 
        easily provide a living wage for the team members. This living wage covers consumables, rent, and 
        the time taken to learn the tools (as it has been factored into the time estimate).
